  ## Description 

  This is a sample ecommerce website built using commerce.js and stripe.  Built entirely with React.js and styled with Material-UI.  Commerce.js handles the products on the back end and stripe handles the payments! Credit to JavaScript Mastery (https://github.com/adrianhajdin) for the inspiration and the guide on building this site!

  ** Note that you can't actually buy the items on this site, just for fun! **
